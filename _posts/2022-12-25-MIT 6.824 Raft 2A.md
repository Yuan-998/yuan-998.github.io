# Some Thoughts after Completing Raft Leader Election Process

## Some Comments Beforehead
The raft algorithm itself has been discussed in great detail in this paper, *[In search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)* . 

Although the functionality and correctness of each part of raft algorithm are quite clear, how these parts are coupling with each other remains unknown for me. 

In this article I will try to explain my understanding of how the system parts are connected together in order to fullfill the leader election process.

## System Structure

### Workflow of a server node

### Election Part

### Heartbeat Part

## Personal Experience
