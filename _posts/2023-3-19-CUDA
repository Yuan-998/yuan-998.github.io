### 1. Host functions access memory allocated by cudaMalloc()

<cite>
You can pass pointers allocated with cudaMalloc() to functions that execute on the host.
</cite>

However, the code that executes on the host cannot use pointers allocated with *cudaMalloc()* to read or write memory.

But why are functions running on the host able to do so?

### 2. Semantic of cudaMemcpy()
```c
cudaMemcpy(&c, dev_c, sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost); // Device to host

cudaMemcpy(data, data_cpu,alloc_max, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice); // Host to device
```

`cudaMemcpy(1st, 2nd, ..., ...)` the 1st argument is always the destination and the 2nd argument is always the source.

### 3. CUDA Memory Model

`cudaMalloc()` and `cudaFree()` manage **global memory**.
